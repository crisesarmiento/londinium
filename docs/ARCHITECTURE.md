# Architecture — Londinium M1 (proposal)

Technical companion to `docs/GDD.md`. The GDD says *what*; this says *how the code is organized*.
Changes to this file go through a normal PR reviewed by Cristian.

## Principles
1. **Simulation is pure data + logic.** `src/sim/` never touches nodes, scenes or the UI, so it runs
   headless in tests at thousands of ticks per second. (Same split as IndustrieLite and gatewarden:
   fixed-timestep sim, data-driven recipes, headless tests in CI.)
2. **Deterministic fixed tick.** 1 tick = 1 game second at 1x speed. A thin `SimClock` node accumulates
   real `delta × speed` and calls `sim.tick()` in whole steps (capped per frame). Same seed + same
   commands ⇒ same state. Randomness (wheat price) only via the sim's seeded `RandomNumberGenerator`.
3. **Everything tunable lives in `data/`** as JSON, read through `Params.get_value(key)`, which applies the
   active role's modifier list (empty for the neutral administrator in M1, D-014 / D-019).
4. **UI sends commands, reads snapshots.** `Simulation.apply_command(cmd)` (build, demolish, set_tax,
   order_wheat, toggle_tea, …) is the only way to change state. After each tick the sim emits a read-only
   snapshot + per-minute stats for the panel. The command log also gives free replays and, later, saves.
5. **Nodes, not ECS.** M1 has tens of buildings, not thousands; plain typed classes + arrays are enough.
   No ECS framework, no C#.

## Tick order (one place, `simulation.gd`)
1. Apply queued commands.
2. Assign workers automatically: first one worker per building in chain order (wharf → mill → bakery), then the rest by priority bakery → mill → wharf; emigration frees jobs in reverse order (D-021).
3. Sources: the market reprices (every `price_update_seconds`), stored wheat spoils a little, and the wharf buys wheat at the
   current price under the player's policy (`SetWheatPolicy`: accumulate price, max price, target stock and a safety reserve in minutes of mill,
   under which the max price stops applying; the pause toggle stops all buying). The warehouse has a capacity. The wharf buys imported flour that skips the mill
   (D-026); wheat fields on cultivable cells only.
4. Converters: mill (wheat→flour), bakery (flour→bread), limited by staffed jobs and input stock.
5. Consumption: bread eaten per person; tea if available (D-025); stale bread decays.
6. Hunger coverage: smooth bread coverage once, shared by hunger emigration and hunger riot defeat.
7. Satisfaction 0–100 with breakdown (bread covered, tea, tax burden, overcrowding).
8. Growth: hunger emigration with hysteresis takes priority; otherwise immigration if satisfaction high and housing free, emigration if low.
9. Money: taxes from employed workers only; minus wages and building upkeep.
10. Defeat: update warning/defeat timers (bankruptcy, hunger riot, depopulation).
11. Stats + snapshot emitted.

## Data example (shape only — numbers are placeholders owned by Mason, approved by Cristian)
```json
// data/economy/buildings.json
{
  "bakery": {
    "cost": 0, "upkeep_per_minute": 0, "jobs": 0,
    "recipe": { "inputs": { "flour": 0 }, "outputs": { "bread": 0 }, "seconds": 0 },
    "tags": ["producer"]
  }
}
// data/roles/neutral_administrator.json
{ "id": "neutral_administrator", "modifiers": [] }
// a future role would add e.g. { "key": "building.bakery.recipe.seconds", "op": "mul", "value": 0.9 }
```
Parameter keys are dotted paths into the data (`building.bakery.jobs`, `defeat.hunger.threshold`).
`test_data_valid.gd` fails if code asks for a key that doesn't exist or a modifier targets a missing key.

## Conventions worth stating
- Money is `int` in pence; display converts to £/s/d or decimals in the UI only.
- Monetary parameters round to the nearest penny once, after the entire modifier list;
  ties round away from zero (2.5 → 3, -2.5 → -3). Non-monetary parameters are not rounded.
- Time in data is in game seconds; the UI may show minutes.
- Save/load is out of M1, but state classes expose `to_dict()`/`from_dict()` so it's cheap later.
- Renderer: **Compatibility** (OpenGL) — enough for 2D squares, runs on older Macs/PCs and in CI.
